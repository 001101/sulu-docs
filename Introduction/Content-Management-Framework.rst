Introduction
============
Let’s talk about the difference between a „Content Management Framework“ and a „Content Management System“ as we understand it first. This will prevent some irritations later.

A „Content Management Framework“ (or CMF as cool and lazy people call it) is a set of components that can be used to build a data administration environment customized to the individual needs of the project or client and used for data driven systems, web-apps or large scale web platforms. A „Content Management System“ (or CMS as you might have guessed) is a more or less standardized software with a fixed set of functionalities mainly focused on the management of websites.

Sulu can be both, a CMF or a CMS, but in this documentation we will focus exclusively on the usage as a Content Management System.
The basics
Sulu was created to manage the content of websites and fully support the 4-step „Content Life Cycle“ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_lifecycle):

1. Content creation/collection
2. Revision/approval
3. Publishing
4. Archiving
 
The main publishing format is normally HTML but others such as e.g. XML can be easily applied. Sulu was designed to create webpages with high performance in the current state of the internet. This means a high focus on web standards (as described in the W3C standards http://www.w3.org/standards/) and search engine optimization. Furthermore it supports multi-language websites and multi-site platforms with shareable content.

Although Sulu focuses on more complex websites it still provides an UI that is easy to understand, fast to learn and enjoyable to use. The software runs on modern browsers without the need of any plugins and will work on a standard state-of-the-art PC or tablet.
